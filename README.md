WorkHorse
=========

Work Horse is an line of business web application that is used to create, edit, and manage tickets and work orders for your companys IT staff. It is accessible on Internet/Intranet and for technician workstations, there is a companion desktop application, also called Work Horse Lite, that pulls tickets from the database and shows which have been worked and which need to be worked. This is ideal for help desk support being able to check the status and make mild adjustments but have the ability to escalate and communicate with senior level IT/escalation. The companion application will also offer features similar to the web application but will not offer full line of features. The desktop application can be deployed to Windows 7/Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012 R2 clients. The web application will be based on ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6. Data will be stored in a SQL database and will implement a RESTful service to facilitate communication for the requesting clients. The desktop application is engineered using Windows Presentation Foundation 4.5/C# and will of course be using the web service and SQL database/EF 6. Documentation will be uploaded shortly.
